title: Good questions to ask as a candidate
---

The best interview processes will recognise that it is a _two way process_:
- The organisation needs to know that you are capable of delivering the work and going to positively impact the culture
- The candidate needs to know that this is a place that you are going to be able to do your best work

As a candidate, you should get a chance to ask some questions and learn as much as you can about what it is <em>actually like</em> to work there.

This can be daunting, so I'm keeping this page updated with a list of questions I've asked or been asked that have given some really great insights or triggered interesting conversations.

Tweak and tailor them to the tone of interview and specifics of the role.

If you have any that you've used or heard, then please let me know! My social links can be found [on my homepage](/).

# General tips
Try to root your questions in what _actually happens_ by asking for a _recent example_ rather than an opinion.

"How would you deal with a production issue?" invites someone to tell your their ideal process, whereas
"Can you tell me about how a recent issue was resolved" asks someone to recall what happened.
