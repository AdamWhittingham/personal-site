# Good questions to ask as a candidate

The best interview processes will recognise that it is a _two way process_:
- The organisation needs to know that you are capable of delivering the work and going to positively impact the culture
- The candidate needs to know that this is a place that you are going to be able to do your best work

As a candidate, you should get a chance to ask some questions and learn as much as you can about what it is <em>actually like</em> to work there.

This can be daunting, so I'm keeping this page updated with a list of questions I've asked or been asked that have given some really great insights or triggered interesting conversations.

If you have any that you've used or heard, then please let me know! My social links can be found [on my homepage](/).

# General tips
## Real examples are better than abstract ideals
Try to root your questions in what _actually happens_ by asking for a _recent example_ rather than an opinion.

"How would you deal with a production issue?" invites someone to tell your their ideal process, whereas
"Can you tell me about how a recent issue was resolved" asks someone to recall what happened.

## Be realistic
Taken the wrong way, some of these questions can sound judgemental.

No organisation is perfect, so be aware that you could be putting someone on the spot - they are going to want to show their organisation in a good light.

Be especially alert for anyone acting defensively or embarrassed - it's important to be respectful and reiterate that you want to know the reality of the job you'd be doing, and that it's unrealistic to expect perfect.

At the same time, don't be fobbed off! We do our best work when we're engaged and nothing will kill that faster than finding out that the culture doesn't align with your values or that your role doesn't match what you expected to be doing.

## Be tactical
You're not going to have time to ask _all_ of these questions, so focus on the areas you have the most doubts and care about the most.
